Currently, the PCFF-INTERFACE, CHARMM-INTERFACE, and CVFF-INTERFACE force fields are included. They contain accurate parameters for the following inorganic compounds merged into the the standard organic/biological force fields:

- Clay minerals
- Fcc metals: Ag, Al, Au, Cu, Ni, Pb, Pd, Pt
- Silica including details of surface chemistry and pH 
- Hydroxyapatite including (h k l) facets and pH resolution
- Cement minerals: C-S-H, tricalcium silicate, tricalcium aluminate, ettringite, monosulfate, tobermorite 11 Å and tobermorite 14 Å, and hydrated phases
- Calcium sulfates: Calcium sulfate (anhydrite), calcium sulfate hemihydrate, and calcium sulfate dihydrate (gypsum)
- PEO (poly(ethylene oxide))
